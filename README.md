# Lyra_Leaf_Chlorose

A lightweight CNN trained on scanned leaves of *Hedera helix* (common ivy) to classify between **healthy** and **chlorotic** specimens.  
This project demonstrates how a minimal yet accurate deep learning model can be trained on real-world data collected from a garden environment.

## üåø Project Summary

This project aims to detect visible chlorosis in leaves of *Hedera helix* using a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained from scratch on a small, well-prepared dataset.  
Leaves were scanned using a flatbed scanner under controlled lighting, and labeled manually based on visual chlorosis symptoms.

## üß† Key Features

- Classification task: **Healthy** vs **Chlorotic** leaves
- Architecture: 3-layer CNN with dropout and data augmentation
- Accuracy: **100% on validation set** (44 images)
- Input: 128√ó128 RGB images from scanned real leaves
- Dataset: 80 images for training, 44 for validation
- Perfect confusion matrix: no false positives or false negatives
- Notebook included: ready-to-run on JupyterLab or Colab

## üî¨ Dataset Details

- Total images: **124**  
- Format: `.png` scanned images (300 DPI)  
- Classes:
  - `saine/` : Healthy leaves
  - `chlorose/` : Visibly chlorotic leaves (yellowing due to iron or nitrogen deficiency)
> üìù **Note on dataset quality**  
> Unlike PlantVillage, which contains field photos taken under variable conditions (lighting, background, camera type), this dataset uses **flatbed-scanned leaves** under **controlled lighting and uniform background**.  
> This ensures **clarity**, **reproducibility**, and a **high signal-to-noise ratio**, making it particularly suitable for **pedagogical uses, diagnostic accuracy, and scientific reproducibility**.
